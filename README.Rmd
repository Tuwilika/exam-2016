```{r setup, echo=TRUE}
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
# Import data
x <- read.csv("question1.csv")
x

# Tidy data
x1 <- boxplot(x$male, x$female, data = x, names = c("males", "females"))
x1

# Statistical test
t.test(x$male, x$female, data = x, paired = FALSE)



```
## Hypotheses
* H0 : the heart rate does not increase with body temperature
* H1 : the heart rate does increase with body temperature

## Test assumptions
* Comparing two, unpaired groups

## Test output
df = 116
p-value = 0.5287

## Test interpretation
* p-value>0.05, therefore accept null hypothesis, and reject alternative hypothesis

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
